# Technology Companies

Microsoft was founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. The company initially focused on developing BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. By the 1980s, Microsoft had become the dominant force in PC operating systems with MS-DOS and later Windows. In 2014, Satya Nadella became CEO, succeeding Steve Ballmer.

Apple Inc. was established in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. The company revolutionized personal computing with the Macintosh in 1984. After Jobs' return in 1997, Apple transformed the music industry with the iPod and iTunes, and later revolutionized mobile phones with the iPhone in 2007.

# Historical Events

The Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the late 18th century. This period marked a major turning point in human history, fundamentally changing economic and social organization. Steam power, mechanized manufacturing, and improved transportation networks revolutionized production methods.

World War II lasted from 1939 to 1945, involving most of the world's nations. The conflict resulted in an estimated 70-85 million fatalities. The war ended with the defeat of the Axis powers and led to the formation of the United Nations.

# Scientific Discoveries

The structure of DNA was discovered by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, with crucial contributions from Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. The double helix model explained how genetic information is stored and replicated in living organisms.

Albert Einstein published his Theory of Special Relativity in 1905, revolutionizing our understanding of space, time, and energy. The famous equation E=mc² demonstrated the relationship between mass and energy.

# Geography

The Amazon Rainforest covers approximately 5.5 million square kilometers, primarily spread across Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. It contains about 10% of the world's known biodiversity and produces about 20% of the world's oxygen.

Mount Everest, standing at 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet), is Earth's highest mountain above sea level. It continues to grow about 4 millimeters (0.16 inches) per year due to geological uplift. The first confirmed summit was achieved by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953.

# Cultural Elements

The Renaissance period, spanning the 14th to 17th centuries, began in Italy and spread throughout Europe. This cultural movement marked the transition from medieval to early modern Europe, characterized by renewed interest in classical learning and artistic innovation.

Jazz music emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in New Orleans, Louisiana. It evolved from a combination of African-American musical traditions, including blues and ragtime. Key figures include Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Miles Davis.

# Medical Advancements

Penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928, though it wasn't mass-produced until the 1940s. This accidental discovery revolutionized medicine by providing the first effective treatment for many bacterial infections.

The first successful human heart transplant was performed by Dr. Christiaan Barnard in South Africa on December 3, 1967. The patient, Louis Washkansky, lived for 18 days after the surgery.

# Economic Concepts

Inflation refers to the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, consequently decreasing purchasing power. The Federal Reserve typically targets an annual inflation rate of 2% in the United States.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the total monetary value of all finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period. It includes all private and public consumption, investments, and net exports.

# Environmental Issues

Global warming is primarily caused by greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. The average global temperature has increased by approximately 1.1°C since pre-industrial times.

Ocean acidification occurs when seawater absorbs excessive carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, leading to a decrease in pH levels. This process threatens marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs and shellfish.
